# PWA IMPORTANT

To run PWA version of the project you must use front directory, and run the following command

```npm build && cd dist && http-server && cd .. ```

This is because vue and webpack do not provide a default way to show on localhost the option for install a pwa application, and in the front-chat directory we have vite, and it needs luck to work as pwa when working on development.

# Run project


For both projects you shoud run the following commands:

- npm run install
- npm run dev


Back end will run on port 3005 and Front on 3002

For the front end, we have used Vue 3 and Vite as bundler in place of webpack.
